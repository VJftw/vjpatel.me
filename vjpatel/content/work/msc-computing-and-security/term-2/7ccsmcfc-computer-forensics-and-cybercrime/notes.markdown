Conventional crimes which may involve the use of a digital system in their commission (e.g., forgery, fraud, blackmail, extortion, embezzlement, theft, etc.) are known as ***Digitally Assisted crimes***.
Crimes in which altering the contents or operation of a digital system or network is the criminals' target (e.g. hacking, malware, denial of service, etc.) are known as ***Digitally Related crimes***.

#### Trends in Computer Crime
Computer crime is divided into (covered by the Computer Misuse Act 1990):
 - Computer Related Crime (CRC): A computer or its contents is the subject of the criminal attack (e.g. Hacking or Denial of Service attacks).
 - Computer Assisted Crime (CAC): A computer is an accessory to the crime (e.g. Financial Fraud or Embezzlement).

**Software Bombs** consist of a trigger and a payload (often a destructive payload for blackmail/sabotage). The trigger can be:
 - Time Bomb: date/time trigger.
 - Logic Bomb: logical condition trigger.

**Trojan Horses** need to be explicitly ran by a user for it to run their hidden side-effects.

**Worms** are replicators that do not necessarily damage information, but instead use up computer resources until the computer ceases to function, thus can be used for extortion, black-mail and sabotage.

**Viruses** are parasitic replicators that need to attach themselves to other executables.

This originally started off as a smart mirror project, but after deciding that a £150+ mirror was too expensive (£35 - RPi, £100 - monitor, £20 - two-way reflective acrylic), I decided to opt for the official [RPi 7" Touchscreen display](https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-78156/l/raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen-display) with a Raspberry Pi 3 and build a useful HUD.

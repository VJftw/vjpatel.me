## Lecture 2 - Classification of Digital Crime - Digitally Assisted Crime & Digitally Related Crime

### Definitions
  - **Crime**: An action which constitutes an offence and is punishable by law.
  - **Digital crime**: Crime not only across networks, but across all digital devices. e.g. GPS, game controllers, the national infrastructure systems.
  - **Computer crime**:
  - **Cyber-crime**: A crime committed across a network.
  - **Forensics**: The process of getting evidence that will be acceptable in a court of law.
  - **Digital forensics**: Forensics from
  - **Computer forensics**: Anything regarding a computer
  - **Cyber-forensics**: Forensics across a large network.
  - **eDiscovery**: Looking into systems to find out how well they are running or secure. Normally part of a civil law, which doesn't require evidence of the same strictness or standard as criminal evidence.

Conventional crimes which may involve the use of a digital system in their commission (e.g., forgery, fraud, blackmail, extortion, embezzlement, theft, etc.) are known as ***Digitally Assisted crimes***.
Crimes in which altering the contents or operation of a digital system or network is the criminals' target (e.g. hacking, malware, denial of service, etc.) are known as ***Digitally Related crimes***.

### Article
#### Trends in Computer Crime
Computer crime is divided into (covered by the Computer Misuse Act 1990):
 - Computer Related Crime (CRC): A computer or its contents is the subject of the criminal attack (e.g. Hacking or Denial of Service attacks).
 - Computer Assisted Crime (CAC): A computer is an accessory to the crime (e.g. Financial Fraud or Embezzlement).

**Software Bombs** consist of a trigger and a payload (often a destructive payload for blackmail/sabotage). The trigger can be:
 - Time Bomb: date/time trigger.
 - Logic Bomb: logical condition trigger.

**Trojan Horses** need to be explicitly ran by a user for it to run their hidden side-effects.

**Worms** are replicators that do not necessarily damage information, but instead use up computer resources until the computer ceases to function, thus can be used for extortion, black-mail and sabotage.

**Viruses** are parasitic replicators that need to attach themselves to other executables.

## Lecture 3 - Cost of Cybercrime

Most (~85%?) goes unreported, due to fears of over loss of brand reputation, business confidence, market share, etc. Estimates vary from £2.2bn to £27bn pa in UK, and from £33bn to £643bn pa worldwide, depending on definitions and methodologies.

Study the UK Cabinet Office report (2011), particularly pp.2-3; the WEIS paper (2012), particularly Table 1; and the UK Home Office review (2013), particularly the Summary on p.14, and the Ponemon Institute report (2015), particularly Figure 1 & p.4, which suggests £5bn pa for the UK.

Malware attacks on businesses occur every 1–3 minutes – see the FireEye report (2012).

### UK Cabinet Office Report 2011
pp.2-3:

This report estimates the cost of cyber-crime in the UK economy to be £27bn with Intellectual Property theft at the top with £9b.

This shows that the impact of cyber-crime does not fall equally across all sectors, therefore businesses need to look again at their defences. They believe that the cost of cyber-crime will rise even further as UK businesses increase their reliance on ICT.

### WEIS 2012
Table 1

They scaled the global estimates to the UK using the UK's share of GDP for a lot of the types of cyber-crime.

### UK Home Office Review 2013
p.14

>Estimating the costs of cyber crime is challenging and there are limitations with previous research that has attempted to produce estimates. As outlined by the Home Affairs Select Committee report on e-crime (Home Affairs Select Committee, 2013), the precision of Detica’s (2011) £27 billion estimate has been questioned due to the lack of robust and transparent data upon which their estimates were based. Progress in this complex area has been made with work conducted by Anderson et al. (2012) who estimated separate costs for different cyber crimes, opting not to produce one total estimate given the paucity and reliability of the data available. However, there are also limitations with Anderson et al.’s approach, which relies partly on scaled down global estimates and case-studies, based on the UK being five per cent of the world gross domestic product (GDP). The UK cyber security strategy (Cabinet Office, 2011) recognised the challenges in this area and noted “a truly robust estimate will probably never be established, but it is clear the costs are high and rising”. Based on the limited research available at present, for example, drawing upon Anderson et al. (2012), the costs of cyber crime could reasonably be assessed to equate to at least several billion pounds per year.

To improve cyber-crime evidence base
 - recording mechanisms that accurately distinguish between online and offline crime.
 - more reporting of cyber-crime from public and businesses and better awareness that some cyber incidences are actually crimes.
 - consistency between the measurement and definitions of cyber crime within the relevant research.
 - transparency and comparability of information from industry sources.
 - methodologically sound surveys of victims.
 - cyber crime can be large scale that could result in a relationship between victims and offenders that is different to offline crime.
 - cyber crime is not constrained by national boundaries.

### Ponemon Institute Report 2015
Figure 1 & p.4

Figure 1 shows the total average costs of cyber-crime in 7 countries. The US total average is $15m, Russia at $2m and the UK at $6m.

 - 39 UK-based organisations were surveyed. The mean average cyber-crime cost  was £4.1m per year.
 - Positive relationship between organisation size and annual cyber-crime  cost.
 - All industries are victims of cyber-crime but to different degrees.
 - DoS attacks, malicious insiders and web-based attacks were the most  popular and costly.
 - If not resolved quickly, cyber-attacks become more costly.
 - Business disruption is the highest external cost, followed by revenue loss.
 - Recovery and detection are the most costly internal activities.
 - Deployment of security intelligence systems make a difference.

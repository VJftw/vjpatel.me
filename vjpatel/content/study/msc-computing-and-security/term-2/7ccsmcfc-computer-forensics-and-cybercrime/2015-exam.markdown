* System logs
* Temporary files
* Created timestamp meta-data
* GPS of containing device
* Pictures of containing device

### c). List 3 potential sources of digital evidence that can be used to construct a digital geolocational timeline for *an individual*. [10 marks]

* GPS
* CCTV
* Authentication (ID cards, logging into system)

### d). When analysing the recovered digital timestamp evidence from various digital devices, what factors must be taken into account if potentially misleading results are to be avoided in constructing a geolocational timeline?

*


## Question 2

### a). State *Locard's Principle*. [6 marks]

"Every contact leaves a trace."

### b). Does Locard's Principle apply in cyberspace? Justify your answer. [9 marks]



### c). 'Freeze and Seize' is a part of every CSI's job; explain under what circumstances freezing a digital crime scene and seizing digital items for subsequent digital forensic investigation may be less straightforward than for a conventional crime scene. [20 marks]

### d). Suppose that you are a member of a digital forensic CSI team, sent to a property to search for and seize digital items suspected of being associated with downloading child pornographic images from the internet. Your information is that the suspect is currently online and is technically sophisticated. List 7 distinct tactics you might consider adopting in order to avoid the suspect erasing the digital evidence you wish to recovre before you can seize the devices. [15 marks]


## Question 3

### a). Define the term *Forensic Readiness* [10 marks]

### b). List the 10 steps to digital forensic readiness as proposed by Rowlingson. [30 marks]

### c). In your capacity as a digital forensic investigator you are dispatched to a large organisation which has reported that it is has been the target of a hostile data exfiltration attack. Assuming that the organisation in question is compliant with the principles of forensic readiness, list 6 forensically useful artefacts you would expect to recover in order to assist your investigation, and explain how you would confirm that these artefacts had not been tampered with. [10 marks]


## Question 4

### a). Outline the 3 principal offences defined by the UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 as modified by the Police & Justice Act 2006. [15 marks]

### b). Outline the 2 provisions of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which may assist digital forensic investigators in their investigations. [10 marks]

### c). Behavioural profiling of cybercriminals is a relatively recent development. Explain why it is important, and list 10 online behavioural traits that are typically searched for by digital forensic investigators to identify individual cybercriminals. [25 marks]

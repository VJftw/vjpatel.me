Homomorphic encryption describes the ability to encrypt values in such a way that external processes can perform operations on them without requiring knowledge of the key such that encrypted values are mutable.

My dissertation implementation is available here: <a href="http://homomorphic-encryption.vjpatel.me" target="_blank">homomorphic-encryption.vjpatel.me</a>
